# Toggle Password with vanilla JS

Your task here is to build something like this
![toggle password](https://cdn.dribbble.com/users/213811/screenshots/2916762/password_visibility_toggle.gif)

It's not mandatory to build it exactly like this, but the essential is to have a button or something when we click on it the password should appear or disappear
