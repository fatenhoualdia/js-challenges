# Challenge: Array Intersection

## Instructions

Write a function called `arrayIntersection` that takes in two arrays and returns an array containing the intersection of the two input arrays (i.e., the common elements that appear in both arrays).

### Function Signature

```js
/**
 * Returns the intersection of two arrays.
 * @param {number[]} arr1 - The first array.
 * @param {number[]} arr2 - The second array.
 * @returns {number[]} - The intersection of the two arrays.
 */
function arrayIntersection(arr1: number[], arr2: number[]): number[];
```

### Examples

```js
arrayIntersection([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]); // should return [1, 3, 5]
arrayIntersection([1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]); // should return []
arrayIntersection([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]); // should return [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

### Constraints

- The input arrays can contain any number of elements
- The input arrays can contain any positive integer

### Hints

- You could use a for loop to iterate through the first array and check if each element is in the second array using the `includes` method.
- You could also take the approach of using a Set to store the elements of the first array and then iterate through the second array and check if each element is in the Set using the `has` method.
